The google_weather script is licensed under GPL v3.

Dependency: xsltproc, curl, conky-all

This is a simple bash script which is called from Conky.

The script downloads weather information from Google in XML format.

The XML file is processed via different XSLT style sheets.

First, install the ConkyWeather.otf & weather.ttf dingbat fonts (see conkyrc-POC comments).

.conkyrc format:
${execi 1800 /path/to/weather/weather.sh "location" option } Note: do not use ~/weather/weather.sh shortcut

.conkyrc examples:
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" }     - prints current conditions
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" ccb}  - prints current condition (big format)
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" ccti} - prints today's high/low temps (imperial)
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" cctm} - prints today's high/low temps (metric)
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" cp}   - prints symbol for current condition
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" ctbi} - prints current temp (big format - imperial)
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" ctbm} - prints current temp (big format - metric)
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" dl}   - prints list of days for forecast
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" fcp}  - prints symbols for forecast conditions
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" fcti} - prints forecast high/low temps (imperial)
${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh "Munich,Germany" fctm} - prints forecast high/low temps (metric)

NOTE:  ++ Be sure to comment/uncomment the necessary CURLURL string
          in weather.sh for Imperial or Metric weather stats.

       ++ Always delete your old weatherInfo.xml cache file, when
          changing between Imperial and Metric weather stats.

 Feel free to experiment with the city/postal code format in .conkyrc:
 ${execi 1800 /path/to/weather/weather.sh "Phoenix" }
 ${execi 1800 /path/to/weather/weather.sh "Phoenix+AZ" }
 ${execi 1800 /path/to/weather/weather.sh "Phoenix+AZ,USA" }
 ${execi 1800 /path/to/weather/weather.sh "85001" }

 Google Weather API XML output can be tested in a web browser window:

 http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather=Phoenix+AZ
 http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather=Phoenix+AZ,USA
