<!-- fcDayList.xslt

This XSLT is used to translate an XML response from the www.google.com/ig/ XML API.

This style sheet shows the FORECAST DAYS-OF-THE-WEEK in the Conky Weather Section, e.g.
the 3 days that are listed at the top of the 3-day forecast.

The second line (condition icons) in the 3-day forecast is handled by: fcConditions.xslt

The third line (temperatures) is handled by: FcTemp.Imperial.xslt and/or FcTemp.Metric.xslt

Adjust the number of empty spaces (as noted below) to align the horizontal spacing of the
forecast days-of-the-week on your desktop.  This works in conjunction with the font size
that you chose to use in your .conkyrc file, and will require some patience to setup.  :)

This is a base adjustment.  Once you get the horizontal alignment into the ballpark, the rest
of the spacing & alignment will handled, as usual, by making adjustments to the Weather Section
in your .conkyrc file.

NOTE:   ++ Use MONO FONTS ONLY for the FORECAST DAYS-OF-THE-WEEK, in your .conkyrc file!
